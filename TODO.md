- Clarify the syntax of paths. Support keys (ie sub-paths) with spaces in them by using quotation marks.
- Update the definition-expression syntax for arrays/objects and not simply rely on the JSON parser. For example, I'd like to support quoteless strings.
- Improve the deletion code.
- Write spec tests, especially for paths and expressions.
- Can I support binary/octal/hexadecimal in my integer class?
- Extract and Delete are two sides of the same coin.
-- Any chance of writing an iterator converting the hash into an array of 2-tuple [(path_1,value_1), (path_2,value_2), ...] etc
- An iterator allows me write a different kind of output format, but it'll need to wait until the path syntax is more refined
-- Deletion is then simply a: grep -v "^$path" (kinda, ignoring some corner cases)
-- Extraction is: grep "^${path}" | sed -e "s/^${path}\.//"
-- Insertion is: sed -e "s/^/${path}./"
-- Definition is: echo "${path}=${value}"
-- Canonicalisation is: sort
- I think extract should also accept a list of paths
